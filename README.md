# CS305 - Software Security
Below is the information on the projects done for the class

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its clients, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations and requires the most current and effective software security as it is a crucial part of its custom software's success. They are seeking software security expertise from Global Rain about client data and financial information protection. Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to its web app to ensure secure communications.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I believe I did very well when I found my client's software security vulnerabilities was identifying how to mitigate exploitation in the system. It is important to code securely because malicious actors can attack your system, steal your data, and use the stolen information to their benefit. Software security adds value to the integrity of the company's overall well-being for its customers, employees, and software.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging was determining which vulnerabilities were relevant to my program. After the vulnerability assessment, knowing the vulnerabilities helped me know what to refactor and how to reorganize the code base.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by knowing the vulnerabilities in the software and combating them based on the information on it. I combatted it by updating software, refactoring the codebase, and evaluating the codebase for any errors. In the future, I would continue to use the dependency check reports to know what the software is susceptible to and decide which mitigation to use based on the information given in the report.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
In order to make certain the code and software application were functional and secure, I constantly ran the program and ran the dependency reports to ensure what the vulnerabilities were throughout development and that no coding updates changed the program's functionality. I also ensured that the certificates and keys were installed into the software to be used for the webpage that displays the algorithm information. I checked if it introduced new vulnerabilities by conducting a vulnerability check before and after I changed the software and cross-referencing the two reports.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources, tools, and coding practices I used were online resources that I have referenced in the report. The websites I used will help me in future assignments and tasks due to the information constantly being updated. 

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In this assignment, I can show employers how my mind works in reports and how I code through the codebase that is also a part of this GitHub page.
